# VNOMobile - port of VNO to Android

One day I thought it would be cool to RP on VNO servers with my friends, while I don't have access to computer.
And here it is! Now you could write silly messages with anime sprites sitting on the toilet!

## Features

- Picking a VNO client to play. Now you don't need to download separate clients. Just launch the app, choose client directory and go to your server!
- Searching by tracks and areas. Remember how uncomfortable it was, when you need to go to ReallyLongNameOfTheLocation location and you can't find it
because the original client clipped it in squares? With VNOMobile you can search what you need!
- Scrollable log. Yeah. Now you don't need to save a replay and try to visually distinguish what is the message and what is not.
- Area pictures. Now when you scroll areas, you will see according backgrounds.
- Scrollable character list and button list.

## Original client features not implemented yet

- The ability to change box name to mysteryname or username. But if somebody from original client do this -- it will show up on the scene page.
- Playing music and showing images from url
- Showing who is in the area.
- HP stuff
- Mod/Admin stuff.
- Volume
- Items. Fuck items.

Maybe something else I don't remember.

## TODO

- Implement original client features.
- Write more info to the OOC/Log, like time of the entry, etc.
- Make a parser for the OOC so you could add emojis like in discord (::pogchamp::)
- Maybe add the ability to spawn several "Clients" so you could switch between characters.
- Handle disconnections with some kind of dialog.
